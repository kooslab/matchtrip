## Quick Reference Guide

### Regular Maintenance Schedule

| Frequency | Task | Script Location |
|-----------|------|-----------------|
| Weekly | Clean orphaned sessions | `active/sessions/clean-orphaned-sessions.ts` |

### Common Operations

#### üîÑ Display ID Management
```bash
# Check current display ID format
bun run scripts/active/display-ids/verify-display-ids.ts

# Migrate to new format (dev)
DRY_RUN=true bun run scripts/active/display-ids/migrate-display-ids-dev.ts
```

#### üßπ Session Cleanup
```bash
# Clean development sessions
bun run scripts/active/sessions/clean-orphaned-sessions.ts

# Clean production sessions (use with caution)
bun run scripts/active/sessions/clean-prod-orphaned-sessions.ts
```

```

## Important Notes

1. **Always run with DRY_RUN=true first** for any migration or cleanup script
2. **Production scripts** require explicit confirmation flags
3. **Backup before major operations** using the backup script
4. **Check logs** - Many scripts create detailed logs in the `logs/` directory
5. **Never run archived scripts** without understanding their historical context

## Environment Variables

Most scripts respect these environment variables:
- `DRY_RUN=true` - Preview changes without applying them
- `CONFIRM_PRODUCTION=yes` - Required for production operations
- `CREATE_BACKUP=true` - Create backups before operations

## Support

For questions about specific scripts, check the README in each subdirectory or refer to the inline documentation in the script files.
